# Setup

Granite.Code is available as an extension [on the VS Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=redhat.granitecode), and can be installed on Windows, Mac, and Linux.

## Post-install setup

Once you have installed Granite.Code, it is necessary to get the latest Granite models ready for local use. To do this, Granite.Code launches a setup wizard which sets up the environment and downloads the models.

If you need to restart the setup wizard for any reason, it can be launched from the VS Code command palette using the `Granite.Code: Setup Granite as code assistant` command.

Once you have set up Granite.Code, we recommend that you try out the [getting started tutorial](getting-started).

## System requirements

Granite.Code should only be used with hardware that is capable of effectively running the Granite models.

Recommended hardware:

* Mac: Apple Silicon systems with at least 20GB memory
* Linux and Windows: systems with a discrete NVIDIA or AMD GPU
